// a circular linked list can have only reference direction
// or a double reference as with the doubly linked list. The only difference
// between the circular linked list and a linked list is that the element's
// next (tail.next) pointer does not make a reference to null, but to the
// first element (head)

// a doubly circular linked list has tail.next pointing to the head element
// and head.prev pointing to the tail element.
