// A Graph is an abstract model of a network structure. A graph is a set
// of nodes (or vertices) connected by edges. Learning about graphs is important
// because any binary relationship can be represented by a graph

// Any social network, Facebook, Twitter etc. can be represented by a graph
// We can also use graphs to represent roads, flights, and communications

// A graph is represented as G = (V,E)
// V: A set of vertices
// E: A set of edges connection the vertices in V
